# FarEarth 3.18.0 release notes
#### *Release Date - 03 October 2024*

> Back to the [All Release notes](releaseNotesSummary.md)

### New Features
* Allow the base container in our CI deployment to host locally deployed executors
* Add ephemeris overlap percentage to L0 reports, indicating if there is sufficient ephemeris, with more than 100% being desirable and less not so much
* Adapt workflow specification to allow for lazy assignment of executors. This allows a user to not specifically specify which executor to use but allows the system to assign it based on desired capabilities
* Numerous UI updates and styling to be more in-line with Pinkmatter standards

### Bug Fixes
* Printed report links not working
* Catalogue details panel cut off
* L0 Reports not showing Eph or Att contact overlap in red
* FarEarth 3 stable Java API missing dependencies
* "ArchiveProductStore" do not update "usedBytes" when a product file is added to the Store

### Support
* Create dynamic archive Python CI test
* Update Print-service (Selenium 4.25.0 and Chromedriver v129)
