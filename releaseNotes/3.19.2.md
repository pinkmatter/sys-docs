### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a problem where local processor app pinning didn’t work when using the Diagnostics executor
* L0 Reports no longer show an empty Temperatures section if the linked metadata files are missing
* Cleaned up duplicate logback.xml warnings that were appearing on startup

* Enterprise Hub wizards now correctly respect user limits
* Fixed Sentinel data download issues from the FarEarth Ancillary Mirror
* Local processor capabilities now properly show up in the Gateway after installation
* Executor matching logic was too strict — it now allows different executor instances with varying priorities

* Failed orders now get properly killed off and cleaned up
* Old build directories are now cleaned up automatically

* Fixed an issue where lazy archive executor assignments were broadcasting data to all archives instead of just the target one
* Job log download links now correctly point to the right processor
* Re-deploying the Gateway no longer wipes out previously shared states
* We now handle tagless images in the container registry (null ID) without crashing things
* Fixed the case where a single archive step would be forced out if followed by two other archive steps
* Report generation should no longer time out in low-resource deployments
* Cleaned up excessive logging caused by _DefaultGitSynchronizer_ when monitoring fetches fail
* Executor flags no longer get wiped out to false after bumping to the latest API version
* Fixed incorrect executor revision and build date reporting
* You can now delete invalid archives without issue
* Resolved log flooding in the _MqttClientManager_ message client
* Removed the unused “max processor jobs” column from the processor UI
* Diagnostic executor’s L1C parameter archiving no longer overwrites published assets, even with versioning enabled


### Support
* Archive failure messages have been reworded to be clearer and more useful
* Subscription deletion now properly handles dynamic resources
* Fixed layout and styling problems in the Markdown viewer
* Added support for running multiple executor versions at the same time in one runtime
